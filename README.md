# Pong Game

A simple Pong game built with Python and the `turtle` graphics library. This project demonstrates the basics of object-oriented programming (OOP) and how to handle user inputs, collisions, and scores in a 2D game using Python's built-in libraries.

## Features:
- **Two Player Mode**: Player 1 controls the left paddle using the "W" and "S" keys, while Player 2 controls the right paddle with the "Up" and "Down" arrow keys.
- **Ball Movement**: The ball bounces off the top and bottom of the screen, as well as the paddles.
- **Score System**: Each player earns a point when the ball passes the opponent's paddle. The scores are displayed at the top of the screen.
- **Speed Increase**: The ball's speed increases every time it hits a paddle, making the game progressively more challenging.
- **Game Reset**: The ball resets to the center of the screen after each point.

To run this game, you need Python installed on your computer. The following libraries are required:
- **Python 3.x**: You can download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
- **turtle**: The `turtle` graphics library is used for creating the graphical user interface and handling user inputs. It is pre-installed with Python, so no additional installation is required.

## How to Run:
1. Ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your computer.
2. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory in the terminal/command prompt.
4. Run the game by executing:
   ```bash
   python main.py
